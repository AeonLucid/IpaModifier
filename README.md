# IpaModifier

Small tool to quickly iterate on iOS IPA modifications so not much manual work is needed. I don't plan to maintain this actively and only add / update what I need myself.

Feel free to create issues / PR but I doubt this tool will be useful for you.

## Usage

`python main.py App.ipa Config.json`

View an example config [here](examples/discord_config.json).

You can delete options from the config to skip them.
